                    It is the 5th longest bridge in India after Bhupen Hazarika Setu, Dibang River Bridge, Mahatma Gandhi Setu and Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The bridge was constructed by a consortium of construction companies headed by Hindustan Construction Company.The bridge has a double rail line on the lower deck and a three lane road on the upper deck. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">The Mysore Palace is a historical palace and the royal residence(house) at Mysore in the Indian State of Karnataka. It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort.

                    The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as puragiri (literally, citadel), and is now known as the Old Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was demolished and constructed multiple times. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">The Orange Festival of Adventure & Music (OFAM) pitches itself as India’s first fest that combines adventure sports and music gigs on one platform. So much so that getting to Dambuk — the village that hosts the four-day event — is an off-road challenge in itself. A bumpy SUV negotiating rickety roads, tea estates, slush, jungle dirt tracks and, of course, orange orchards makes its way to Dambuk.

                    Nestled deep inside Arunachal Pradesh’s Lower Dibang Valley, Dambuk is known to produce some of the best oranges in the country and, hence, the name Orange Festival. Counted as the 10th least populous district of the country, Dambuk remains cut off for almost six months of the year. A chopper, or a more daredevil elephant ride, takes you to Dambuk during these monsoon months. But when the sky clears, OFAM invites adrenaline and music junkies to this quaint valley.</p>

                <p>Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse the damage caused by Thanos in Infinity War.</p>
                <p>
                    The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise, as well as music from previous films. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York state, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.</p>

                <p>Godzilla vs. Kong is a 2021 American monster film directed by Adam Wingard. A sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) and Kong: Skull Island (2017), it is the fourth film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. It is also the 36th film in the Godzilla franchise, the twelfth film in the King Kong franchise, and the fourth Godzilla film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio.[b] The film stars Alexander Skarsgård, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Shun Oguri, Eiza González, Julian Dennison, Lance Reddick, Kyle Chandler, and Demián Bichir. In the film, Kong clashes with Godzilla as humans lure the ape into the Hollow Earth to retrieve a power source for a weapon to stop Godzilla's mysterious rampages.</p>
                <p>
                    The project was announced in October 2015 when Legendary announced plans for a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and King Kong. The film's writers room was assembled in March 2017, and Wingard was announced as the director in May 2017. Principal photography began in November 2018 in Hawaii, Australia and Hong Kong, and wrapped in April 2019.</p>
                <p>
                    After being delayed from a November 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Godzilla vs. Kong was theatrically released internationally on March 24, 2021, and in the United States on March 31, where it was released in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the visual effects and action sequences, but criticism towards the script and human characters. It broke several pandemic box office records, and has grossed $436.7 million worldwide, against a production budget between $155–200 million and a break-even point of $330 million, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2021. The film was also a streaming hit, becoming the most successful launch item in HBO Max's history at the time of its release.</p>

This carefully researched, and now newly updated, up-to-the-minute biography and tribute gives a rich picture of Hawking's remarkable life – his childhood, the heart-rending beginning of his struggle with motor neurone disease, his ever-increasing international fame, and his long personal battle for survival in pursuit of a scientific understanding of the universe. From more recent years, Kitty Ferguson describes his inspiring leadership at the London Paralympic Games, the release of the film The Theory of Everything, his continuing work on black holes and the origin of the universe, the discovery of ‘supertranslations’, and the astounding ‘Starshot’ program. Here also are his intense concern for the future of the Earth and his use of his celebrity to fight for environmental and humanitarian causes, and, finally, a ground-breaking paper he was working on at the time of his death, in which he took issue with some of his own earlier theories. Throughout, Ferguson summarizes and explains the cutting-edge science in which Hawking was engaged.<br>

                        <p class="p_modal">Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a critically acclaimed, bestselling space flight simulator game. It’s making waves everywhere from mainstream media to the actual space flight industry, but it has a bit of a learning curve. In this book, five KSP nerds—including an astrophysicist—teach you everything you need to know to get a nation of tiny green people into space.</p>
                        <p>
                            KSP is incredibly realistic. When running your space program, you’ll have to consider delta-V budgets, orbital mechanics, Hohmann transfers, and more. This book is perfect for video game players, simulation game players, Minecrafters, and amateur astronomers.</p>

                        <p class="p_modal">Seven lectures by the brilliant theoretical physicist have been compiled into this book to try to explain to the common man, the complex problems of mathematics and the question that has been gripped everyone all for centuries, the theory of existence.</p>
<p>
Undeniably intelligent, witty and childlike in his explanations, the narrator describes every detail about the beginning of the universe. He describes what a theory that can state the initiation of everything would encompass.</p>
<p>
Ideologies about the universe by Aristotle, Augustine, Hubble, Newton and Einstein have all been briefly introduced to the reader. Black holes and Big Bang has been explained in an unsophisticated manner for anyone to understand.</p>
<p>
All these events and individual theories may be strung together to create a theory of the origin of everything and the author strongly believes that the origin might not necessarily be from a singular event. He advocates the idea of a multi-dimensional origin with a no-boundary condition to remain true to the theories of modern physics and quantum physics.</p>
<p>
The book provides a clear view of the world through Stephen’s mind where he respectfully dismisses the belief that the Universe conforms by a supernatural and all-powerful entity.</p><br>
